Common Design Patterns in Python version 3.6+.

# Dependencies
To see which version of Python 3 you have installed, open a command prompt and run

```
  $ python3 --version
```

If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, then you can easily install Python 3.6 with the following commands:

```
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python3.6
```

If youâ€™re using another version of Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, I recommend using the deadsnakes PPA to install Python 3.8:

```
  $ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install python3.8
```

According to the above URL 

"Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code."

This repository is intended to understand and apply some concepts through small projects. These ideas may then be extended to a real-world application.


In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This URL covers three main groups of patterns:

    1. Creational patterns: provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    2. Structural patterns: explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

    3. Behavioral patterns: take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
